# PROJECT NAME

SQL Todo List

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

The app is designed to have the functionality of a basic calculator able to take two inputs and one operator.  It takes the inputs from the HTML page using the client side and sends it to the server to be calculated bundled and sent back to the client so that it may be appended to the DOM.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/);

## Installation

1. Ensure that node is installed
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install --yes`
3. Also run the following, `npm install express --yes`
4. Also run the following `npm install body-parser --yes`
5. Run `node server/server.js`
6. Proceed to your preferred browser and open `localhost:5000` this will be your HomeBase for the project!

## Usage

1. Fill in the first input
2. Select a modifier from the first 4 buttons `+,-,*,/`
3. Fill in the second input
4. Click the `=` button to run the calculation
